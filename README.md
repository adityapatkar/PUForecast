MSML604 (Introduction to Optimization Project: Predicting the output of unpredictable microelectronic Circuits)

Delay-based PUFs are microelectronic circuits that produce unpredictable output values, making them challenging predict. This project aims to predict the output of delay-based PUFs by developing machine learning models that analyze the delay characteristics of these units. The resulting models can help increase the reliability and security of PUF-based systems. This repository contains the code and resources for training and evaluating these models.

## Introduction

For a detailed introduction to the project, please refer to the `MSML_604_Project.pdf` file.

## Getting Started

To get started with development, please follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Create a new branch called `<your_name>/<model_architecture>` from the `main` branch.
3. Make changes to the `predict.m` file.
4. When you're ready to commit your changes, push them to your branch.

## Requirements

To run the project, you will need:

- MATLAB R2021a or later
