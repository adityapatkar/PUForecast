MSML604 (Introduction to Optimization Project: Predicting the output of unpredictable microelectronic Circuits

Delay-based PUFs are microelectronic circuits that produce unpredictable output values, making them challenging predict. This project aims to predict the output of delay-based PUFs by developing machine learning models that analyze the delay characteristics of these units. The resulting models can help increase the reliability and security of PUF-based systems. This repository contains the code and resources for training and evaluating these models.

# Introduction
